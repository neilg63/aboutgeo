  <h1>Reverse Postcode Finder and Geographic Explorer</h1>
  <p>This applications links an <a href="https://www.openstreetmap.org/copyright" target="_blank">OpenStreetMap</a> covering the whole world with two geographic databases and remote Web services. The first contains historical and current timezone data and over 2 million place names around the world with related while the second over 1 million UK post codes with addresses. Extra information such as weather, nearby places of interests and related Wikipedia articles come from <a href="https:www.geonames.org" target="">Geonames.org</a>. and are cached for varying lengths of time.</p>
  <p>The backend uses two micro-services both available on GitHub at <a href="https://github.com/neilg63/geofinder"> GeoFinder</a> and <a href="https://github.com/neilg63/geotime">GeoTime</a></p>

  <h1>Astronomical Calculator</h1>
  <p>This shows the positions, movements and phases of the Ascendant, Sun, Moon and Planet at any time and from any location on Earth. It's powered by my open-source <a href="https://github.com/neilg63/astro-calc-api">AstroCalcApi</a>, which in turn harnesses all the core feature of the famous <a href="https://www.astro.com/">SwissEphmeris</a> calculation engine.</p>
  <p></p>

  <h1>Current and Historical TimeZone Finder</h1>
  <p>This is a simple React app that harnesses the GeoFinder backend to find the correct time zone for any of 44691 towns and cities with some sunrise, sunset and moon phase data provided by AstroCalc.</p>
