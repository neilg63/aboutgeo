  <h1>Reverse Postcode Finder and Geographic Explorer</h1>
  <p>This applications links an <a href="https://www.openstreetmap.org/copyright" target="_blank">OpenStreetMap</a> covering the whole world with two geographic databases and remote Web services. The first contains historical and current timezone data and over 1 million place names around the world while the second contains over 2 million UK post codes with addresses. Extra information such as weather, nearby places of interests and related Wikipedia articles come from <a href="https:www.geonames.org" target="">Geonames.org</a>. and are cached for varying lengths of time.</p>
  <p>The backend uses two micro-services both available on GitHub at <a href="https://github.com/neilg63/geofinder"> GeoFinder</a> and <a href="https://github.com/neilg63/geotime">GeoTime</a></p>

  <h1>Astronomical Calculator</h1>
  <p>This shows the positions, movements and phases of the Ascendant, Sun, Moon and Planet at any time and from any location on Earth. It's powered by my open-source <a href="https://github.com/neilg63/astro-calc-api">AstroCalcApi</a>, which in turn harnesses all the core feature of the famous <a href="https://www.astro.com/">SwissEphmeris</a> calculation engine.</p>
  <p></p>

  <h1>Current and Historical TimeZone Finder</h1>
  <p>This is a simple React app that harnesses the GeoFinder backend to find the correct time zone for any of 44691 towns and cities with some sunrise, sunset and moon phase data provided by AstroCalc.</p>
  <p>This may seem simple, but over the years time zones have changed regularly. Did you know Portugal switched to Central European Time (CET +1) twice from 1966 and again from 1992 and 1996, despite lying more than 6ยบ west of the UTC meridian?</p>
